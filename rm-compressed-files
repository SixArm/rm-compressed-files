##
# This script removes compressed files and related kinds of archive files.
#
# The searches by file name extension:
#
#   * .bz, .bz2, .bzip, .gz, .tar, .tgz, .zip, .7zip.
# 
# Syntax:
# 
#     rm-compressed-files [dir]
# 
# Example to do the current directory:
# 
#     rm-compressed-files
# 
# Example to do a specific directory:
#
#     rm-compressed-files /foo/goo
#
# ## Compatibility notes
#
#  We prefer to be more compatible rather than system-specific.
#
#   * To delete files, we prefer `-exec rm` vs. `-delete`.
#     The former is more compatible, the latter is faster.
#
#   * To name match, we prefer using `-name` vs. `-iname`.
#     This means we need to match on upper case and lower case.
#
#   * To regex match, we prefer patterns to be basic vs. extended.
#     The former is more compatible, the latter is more modern.
#
#   * We prefer POSIX code vs. shell-specific code.
#
#   * We prefer the code to be more DAMP than DRY.
#     For example, the code has separate name matching 
#     for `.bz` and `.bz2`, even though we could combine these.
